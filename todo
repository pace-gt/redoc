why is redoc_all terminating the loop when it has to run an mpi test???
move 3 parameters to config.txt
make symlinks
comment redoc_tagged
in documentation,
    remove features? maybe put one sentence summary in description
    make exact usage and behavior of two scripts more clear. both should now be portable. describe what arguments are for and how necessary they are. make clear that they are alternate ways of using redoc. also explain how to do EVERYTHING, like how to add attribution
    describe every single file in the repo
    describe how users' reframe tests should be organized
    clarify that if redoc_tagged fails on a particular RT you can make that one by hand with redoc.py
    replace "example" with "example exercise" where relevant
delete this todo
check teams todo. add "identify redoc candidates"
adapt script to use existing reframe/pace/<module>/src folders as repo. redoc.py should get this info from config.txt
sift through stuff in my home directory- can I delete or move it?
work summary

long-term improvements: color output? much more aggressive commenting? comprehensive list of compilers and source code file extensions? add license to repo?
