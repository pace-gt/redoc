why is redoc_all terminating the loop when it has to run an mpi RT???
in documentation,
    remove features? maybe put one sentence summary in description
    make exact usage and behavior of two scripts more clear. both should now be portable. describe what arguments are for and how necessary they are. make clear that they are alternate ways of using redoc. also explain how to do EVERYTHING, like how to add attribution
    describe every single file in the repo
    describe how users' reframe tests should be organized, with source folders MUST be public. (source folders CAN be different than src but those docs will not work with redoc_tagged)
    clarify that if redoc_tagged fails on a particular RT you can make that one by hand with redoc.py
    replace "example" with "example exercise" where relevant. in gitlab project description too- wont let me edit :/
    dependencies: in addition to reframe, redoc requires jinja and jq
    set up config in json format with absolute paths, or redoc_tagged will not work
delete this todo
check teams todo. add "identify redoc candidates" and some of the long term stuff below
adapt script to use existing reframe/pace/<module>/src folders as repo. redoc.py should get this info from config.txt
sift through stuff in my home directory- can I delete or move it?
work summary
check email

long-term improvements: color output? symlinks? much more aggressive commenting? comprehensive list of compilers and source code file extensions? add license to repo?
