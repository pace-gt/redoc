why is redoc_all terminating the loop when it has to run an mpi RT??? fix
how did Kevin specify src as default source location? add to readme
add support for alternative lmod install locations or lack thereof
in documentation,
    replace "example" with "example exercise" where relevant.
    dependencies: in addition to reframe, redoc requires jinja and jq
    set up config in json format with absolute paths, or redoc_tagged will not work
delete this todo
replace gitlab project description with top tagline from readme. it wont let me :/
check teams todo. add "identify redoc candidates" and some of the long term stuff below
adapt script to use existing reframe/pace/<module>/src folders as repo. redoc.py should get this info from config.txt
sift through stuff in my home directory- can I delete or move it?
work summary
check email

long-term improvements: color output? symlinks? much more aggressive commenting? comprehensive list of compilers and source code file extensions? add license to repo? make sure reframe and redoc are consistently capitalized in readme.
